# SoulAlchemy
Casual Puzzle game

This game was developed for the Pirate Software game jam: https://itch.io/jam/pirate
Unfortunatelly I didn't manage to finish the game for the jam, but I'm finishing it anyways.

Theme is Alchemy and Shadows, and the theme interpretation is that the real alchemy is the alchemy of the soul.
Feng Shui five elements were the choice for the alchemy part, where we need to follow the element cycle of empowerment and destruction, and another cycle, shadows and light, is used to tell if we use the empowerment or destruction element cycle.

The game is being developed in Godot 4.
